## Code Quality

There is a code linter that should be executed and pass without errors by executing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

The test suite is located in the `test/` directory. All new features are
expected to have corresponding test cases with complete code coverage. Patches
that increase test coverage are happily accepted.

Ensure that the test suite passes by executing:

```bash
npm run test
```

Coverage reports can be generated and viewed by executing:

```bash
npm run coverage
```
